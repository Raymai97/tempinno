## Recommender / Recommendation System

Goal: Make visitor starts buying a product. Make customer starts buying more products.

Advantages:
- Converting visitors into buyers
  - Most site visitors look over the site without pucharsing anything.
  - R.S. attempts to convert visitors into buyers by helping visitors to find products they wish to purchase.

- Increasing cross-sell
  - Cross-sell - practice of offering customers additional items that will go well with the one they are purchasing.
  - For example, if a guy was buying a laptop from the site, the site R.S. may suggest wireless mouse and other thing that complements a laptop.

- Increasing up-sell
  - Up-selling - practice of giving customers the option to buy an item that is slightly better than the one they are considering.
  - The better one usually comes with a higher price tag - hence more profit.
  - For example, if a guy was buying a laptop with Intel Core i3 CPU on it, the site R.S. may suggest upgrading the same laptop to Intel Core i5 CPU, so he will think about getting more powerful laptop by paying more.

- Building loyalty
  - R.S. improves loyalty by creating value-added relationship between the site and the customer.
  - Sites that use R.S. learns about their customers, hence able to provide custom interfaces that match customer needs.
  - Customers repay that loyalty by being a returning customer.
  - The more the customer uses the R.S., the more loyal he is to the site, the better the R.S. will be in serving him.

Type of Filtering:
  - Collaborative Filtering
    - Works by collecting and analyzing user's behaviors, activities and preferences, then predict what the user will like based on his or her similarity to other user.
    - Assumes people who agreed in the past will agree in the future - people who liked a kind of thing in the past will like the same kind of thing in the future.
    - To create user profile, it uses 2 forms of data collection:
      - Explicit data collection
        - Asking user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
        - Show a user two items and ask him/her to choose a better one of them.
        - Asking user to rank a collection of items from most preferred to least preferred.
      - Implicit data collection
        - Obtain a list of items viewed by a user.
        - Obtain a list of items purchased by a user.
        - Analyze the user's social network to discover his/her likes and dislikes.
    - Examples:
      - Last.fm observes song tracks that user has listened to, compares his/her listening behaviour against other user's behavior, then recommends song tracks that often played by other users with similar interests.
    - Downside:
      - Cold start: require a lot of existing data to make accurate recommendations.
      - Scalability: often there are too many users and products, which requires a lot of computation power to calculate recommendations.

  - Content-based filtering
    - Like Collaborative Filtering, but instead of suggesting favorites of users that are similar to you, it suggests items or products that are similar to your favourite products.

## Search Engine Marketing
  - Goal: Gaining traffic from search engines.
  - Cover 3 areas:
    - Gain traffic via free SEO efforts
    - Gain traffic via paid search advertising
      - Contextual Advertising
      - Paid inclusions
      - Paid per click (PPC)
    - Gain traffic with social media

### Contextual Advertising

- Advertise stuff that are relevant to the page's content, keywords and phrases.
- For example, on a page about photography, it should shows advertisement for digital camera. This is in constrast to SERP which would show more about photography instead.
- Hard to get it right.

### Paid Inclusion

- Site pay Search Engine to guarantee Site will be in SERP for specific search terms.
- For some Search Engine, their spiders will crawl on paid sites more often than non-paid sites.

### Pay per click (PPC)

- An Internet advertising model where advertisers pay their host only when their ad is clicked.
- Such advertisements are called sponsored links or ads that appear beside or above organic results in SERP.

- PPC Model 1: Flat rate PPC
  - Fixed price for each click.
  - Publisher may provide a rate card that lists out cost-per-click (CPC) in diff area of their website or network. Advertiser may nego for lower rates, esp when committing to a high value contract.

- PPC Model 2: Bid Based PPC
  - Each advertiser informs the host the maximum amount that they are willing to pay for a given ad position (often based on a keyword).
  - Auction is conducted every time a visitor triggers the ad, such as when searching with relevant keyword that is being bid.

- PPC Quality Score
  - To determine order in which ads are listed, this formula will be run on each ad: bid * Quality Score.
  - Purpose: To improve the experience of users who click on sponsored links. It is assumed that when user experience is good, user will click on them more often, gaining Search Engine more advertising revenue.
  - Factors:
    - Ad Copy Relevance
    - CTR (Click-through rate)
    - Landing Page Quality
    - Landing Page Load Time


- PPC Bid Payment
  - Advertisers pay for each click they get. The amount to pay is usually slightly higher than the actual bid amount.
  - This avoids automated sniping where bidders keep adjusting their bids by very small amounts, hoping to win the auction by adding just a bit more bid amount.

- PPC Drawbacks - Click Fraud
